                        <h2>Brands</h2>
                        <p>Two big brands that you will be up against are Lindt and Hershey's. Both are very well known and delicious chocolate makers who will try to snatch away your business.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Strengths</h2>
                        <p>
                            Lindt excells at making high class chocolate for a fancy chocolate eating experience while Hershy makes the perfect evry day chocolate bar.

                        <p>
                            Lindt alienates the lower and middle class by marketing their fancy chocolate. Hershey has very plain branding and not enough pizzaz.

                        <p>
                            This company is clearly a very fun and joyful company with their clever slogan and colourful branding and so the logo reflects that through colours and retro slides.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand?</h2>
                        <p>
                            This logo reflects the happy joyous attidute of the brand as well as having a retro theme which will seperate it from their competitors.

                            This logo is big, colourful and retro which is distinct from lots of other chocolate companies which have plain boring logos.
